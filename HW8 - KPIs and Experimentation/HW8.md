# HW8 - KPIs and Experimentation

One product that I love using is Spotify, specifically the Duo plan which allows for two ad-free Premium accounts. I have been using Spotify since I graduated college, but never fully commited to paying for the ad-free version until I had a stable job and felt prepared to pay for the subscription.

Another service however that I have appreciated in the past is iHeart Radio, which has a very simplified UI and relies exclusively on recommendations to give you your next song. This takes away some of the curation work that is involved with building playlists. 

In addition, Spotify may face increased competition from Youtube Music which is only 2.199 Argentine pesos for a family plan, which allows up to five family members in the same household to share the plan. Meanwhile, Spotify Duo is 4.199 Argentine pesos per month for a family plan (albeit for 6 accounts).

For this reason, I propose three experiments to test Spotify's competitiveness in the market.

## Experiment 1: Auto-Build Playlist Feature to Increase Engagement

**Objective:** Having Spotify do the work of creating personalized playlists for your enjoyment according to your hobbies and time of day may boost engagement. This is because many people may listen to a playlist, but then get tired of skipping songs, especially if they are paying for a Premium membership.

**Null Hypothesis:** Offering an automatic playlist to users will not keep them on the platform for more minutes per session than users without that feature.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Offering an automatic playlist to users will keep them on the platform for more minutes per session than users without that feature.

**Leading Metric:** The number of times a user selects to build a playlist automatically with spotify suggestions.

**Lagging Metric:** The average session length of a user.

**Test cell allocation:** This technology can be expensive so maybe a 25% test and 75% control split.


## Experiment 2: Add Child-mode Button on the Same Account to Reduce Churn

**Objective:** Many parents who are already paying for Spotify Duo may not have a lot of time to use their membership, having other responsibilities. They may eventually give up paying for Spotify Premium by not having enough time to use it.
However, adding a child mode button that activates kid friendly songs and allows for customization per the child's needs, but allow for a parent to quickly switch back to their own account, may reduce the likelihood that a parent stops paying for a premium membership.

**Null Hypothesis:** Adding a child-mode button will not decrease the number of people who stop paying for premium.

**Alternative Hypothesis:**  Adding a child-mode button will decrease the number of people who stop paying for premium.

**Leading Metric:** The number of users who use the child-mode button.

**Lagging Metric:** The number of users who are retained after extended use of Spotify Premium, i.e. six months.

**Test cell allocation:** 50% and 50%.


## Experiment 3: Add Group Account Log-in to Increase Signups

**Objective:** Many users have a close social circle that grows smaller over time. Offering a group account log-in, such as the one that Netflix offers, with pictures and names for different profiles, means that everyone can share the same login and share costs. This may lead to more signups.

**Null Hypothesis:** Offering a group log-in page will not increase signups.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Offering a group log-in page will increase signups.

**Leading Metric:** The number of users who share an account in a week.

**Lagging Metric:** The number of signups that occur on a monthly basis.

**Test cell allocation:** 50% and 50%.
